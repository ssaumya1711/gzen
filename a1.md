1. write a doc for the following below

typeof(1) - number\
typeof(1.1) - number\
typeof('1.1') - string (anything between ''/"" is string)\
typeof(true) - boolean\
typeof(null) - object (typeof null === 'object')\
typeof(undefined) - undefined\
typeof([]) - object\
typeof({}) - object\
typeof(NaN) - number (ECMAScript spec says the Number type includes NaN)

2. doc for the difference between div, article, section tag?

Section tag means that the content inside is grouped (i.e. relates to a single theme), and should appear as an entry in an outline of the page. Div tag, on the other hand, does not convey any meaning, aside from any found in its class, lang and title attributes. The article tag is a self-completed tag, this can be used for any of those reasons, where section tag is required plus the article tag place the content independently. Article tag can be used to place any social post, magazine article, blogs, list of related contents, any independent content.
